This folder contains input data for the project. The input data could be retrieved from dataset.

The dataset contains input data in gz archives, which should be extracted using for example `gzip -d file.gz`

As the input data is a subject of external licenses and those files are big enough, it should not be included under git index.

NOTE: input data for the project consists of 4 files pin_images.csv, pins.csv, repins.csv and users.csv
